                Hi! I would like to take the opportunity offered by this project to present my final one: <em>DesignDetective</em>! the AI design assitant for everyone.
                Simply install the <em>web extension</em> for your favorite browser, (work on chromium browser, <em>not tested on firefox ones.</em>), and get you are all set !
                <em>DesignDetective</em> uses Tensorflow pre-trained AI model to analyse the present web page, (using her url), and return the <em>font</em> used, the <em>hexadecimals</em> value of the color palette & where to find them, or close-enough free alternatives.
                <em>DesignDetective</em> will also be <em>free</em> and <em>opensource</em> and will be maintained through my Github. <em>DesignDetective</em> will not collect any users data for now, since i don't plan on monetize the project.
                Users are limited to 10 API calls a day. (Otherwise and i would have to pay per API calls.) which should be plenty for your design needs !
                Get the extension all of the designers from the web: <em>streamers, content creator, web designers, graphist...</em> Let <em>DesignDetective</em> do the hard work for you!
                (planned release on the 25th of December. <em>Work in proress.</em>)

                Let's get technical !
            </h1>
            <p class="body-text" id="body-second-p">
                Issue is: For now, i don't have any server to deploy my web extension, nor to train an AI model. I can't monetize my project for now because i can't assure my customer will have
                a good support, seemless experience nor secure account. I am still attending CS50x classes, i could figure this out later on. For now, no account, no servers, no data:
                You install the extension, you analyse website. Easy as that.
                I am planning on using TensorFlow trained AI for tis task: Easy, Light-weight (run in their own servers, with an API call ID), Basic "import" in JavaScript.
                Might change my minds in the future, because the free tier of TensorFlow is 100 API calls a day / users. Which seems insanly good, but some, more curious users, could push that boundary.
                After 100 API calls, i have to pay per API calls (which is no good.)
